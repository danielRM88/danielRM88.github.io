**I apologize from the start for the horrible design and color choices for the UI of the app. I am not a designer, it is one of my weaknesses.**

## Introduction
This is an android game built in android studio. The purpose of the game was to emulate the popular italian card game known as Briscola.

The rules of Briscola can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola).

## Architecture
The application was developed trying to follow MVC standards. Figure 1 shows the folder structure of the project.

The game also supported remote play while the server dedicated to do this was up and running. This feature is no longer available but the classes used to accomplish this are still in the repo within the folder 'services'.
