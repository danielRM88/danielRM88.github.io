## Introduction
This is an implementation of the Deep Q-Learning algorithm using Python to build an AI that learns how to play Super Mario Bros.

There are plenty of examples of Reinforcement Learning applied to video games, this was more an attempt to learn and to increase my understanding of both Convolutional Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning, more specifically the Q-Learning algorithm.
