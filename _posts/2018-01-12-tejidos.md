## Introduction
Multilayer service oriented architecture solution developed as an administrative system for a textile company, in order to provide a way to manage and keep track of their inventory and sales.

The project is composed of a backend application built with **Ruby on Rails** with a **PostgreSQL** database, and a frontend application developed in **Reactjs**.

## Backend
The backend of the application consists of a Web API with a Datastore. A RESTful API is implemented following the MVC pattern and JSON web token is used for user authentication. As mentioned before the API is built using Rails and the datastore selected is PostgreSQL.

For this project, the business logic will be placed in the relational database in the form of triggers. These triggers will have the responsability of maintaining a consistent inventory of fabrics. Although I am not a big advocate of having the business logic in the RDMS, it was a good learning exercise.

### Data model
Figure 1 shows the entity relationship diagram created for the application.

### Database
As mentioned before the database selected is PostgreSQL and the business logic of the application will be placed in it. 

To achieve this, several triggers are developed whose purpose can be seen in Figure 1 in the form of notes added to their respective table.

A total of 6 triggers are created:

* **After insert on inventories table**. When a new fabric arrives and it is placed in the inventory, the existences table, which is the one that holds how much stock there is available at the moment, needs to be updated.

                --
                IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN

                    VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.pieces, NEW.amount, NEW.unit, current_timestamp, current_timestamp);

        CREATE TRIGGER update_on_inventory_insert AFTER INSERT ON inventories FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_on_inventory_insert();
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>

* **After update on purchases table**. When a purchase is modified, the existences related to that purchase need to be modified as well. The trigger must check that there is consistency between the inventories table and the existences table. We cannot have existences that come from nowhere!

* **Before delete on purchases table**. When a purchase is deleted, the inventories and existences associated with it must be removed from the system as well. The trigger also checks that there is enough in existences to satisfy the amount of fabrics that were aqcuired in the purchase.

## Frontend
The frontend application is built using Reactjs combined with redux to store the state of the application.

The architecture of the frontend application is heavily based in the one displayed in this great [post](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/a-guide-for-building-a-react-redux-crud-app-7fe0b8943d0f).

Figure 2 shows the frontend application. It is possible to observe that there are four major nav links (in spanish), 'Compras'(Purchases), 'Facturas'(Invoices), 'Inventario'(Inventory) and 'Catalogo'(Catalog) which in turn has 'Telas'(Fabrics), 'Clientes'(Clients) and 'Proveedores'(Providers).

<figure>
  <img src="/images/overall-interface.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 2: home screen of the frontend application</figcaption>
</figure>

Figure 3 shows the index page for fabrics after selecting 'Telas' in the nav bar.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/fabrics-index.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: fabrics index page</figcaption>
</figure>

From here you can create a new fabric, edit or delete one. The edit and create pages use the same form component which can be seen in Figure 4.

<figure>
  <img src="/images/fabrics-edit.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 4: fabrics edit page</figcaption>
</figure>

All the pages except for the 'Inventario'(Inventory) follow this same pattern. An index page to see all the records, a new page to create a new record and an edit page to update it.

Figure 5 shows the create page for a new 'Compra'(Purchase).

<figure>
  <img src="/images/purchase-new.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 5: new purchase</figcaption>
</figure>

Figure 6 shows the 'Inventario'(Inventory) page, which displays the current existences of stock available.
